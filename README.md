# -Data-Collection-and-Web-Scraping
This project demonstrates web scraping with Python using requests, BeautifulSoup, and pandas. 
It covers common scraping challenges such as:  
Pagination → handling multiple pages of data  
Dynamic Content → scraping JavaScript-rendered websites using Selenium  
Data is collected, cleaned, and stored in CSV/JSON formats for further analysis.
